# Baby-Steps-Quicksave-Mod
A very bad quicksave mod using the built-in developer position save and load functions

F9 to save position
F10 to load position

Give it plenty of time to load in the chunks of the area you're loading back in, it can take a while.
Sometimes randomly will get permanently stuck, in that case just restart your game and you should go back to your latest position.
