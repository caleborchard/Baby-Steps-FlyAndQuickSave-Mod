# Baby Steps Fly and QuickSave Mod

# How to install
Follow the start of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQRWCoEZUk) on installing MelonLoader Nightly, and instead of putting the DLL files for the multiplayer mod put the single DLL file for this mod in there.

# Information
A simple mode that adds a flycam (that allows you to teleport the player) and quicksaves.

F1 to toggle the fly cam

Scroll to adjust speed

Shift for speed boost

Ctrl for super speed boost

Hold Alt while scrolling to adjust fly cam FOV

Left click to teleport your player to where you're looking


F9 to save position

F10 to load position


Give it plenty of time to load in the chunks of the area you're loading back in for the quicksave, it can take a while.
When trying to teleport your player it may also take a bit for the terrain to load in. Just keep clicking until it works.

Rarely randomly will get permanently stuck (mostly observed near the starting cave), in that case just restart your game and you should go back to your latest position.
